# Personal Website Redirect

This repository contains a simple HTML redirect to my personal website.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to utilize the GitHub Pages feature to redirect visitors from `germabyte.github.io` to my personal website hosted elsewhere.

## How it works

The `index.html` file in this repository contains a meta refresh tag that automatically redirects visitors to my personal website.

## Note

This is a client-side redirect. The URL in the visitor's browser will change to my personal website's URL after the redirect occurs.

For any questions or concerns, please contact me through my personal website.
