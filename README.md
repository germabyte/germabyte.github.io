# Germabyte's Terminal Website

## Description

This project is a personal portfolio website that emulates a terminal interface, offering a unique and interactive experience. Built entirely with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it allows users to navigate through my professional information and projects using commands similar to a real terminal.

The website detects mobile devices and displays a warning, encouraging users to access it via a desktop for optimal experience.

## Usage

1. **Access the Website**: Open the website in a desktop browser. You'll be greeted with an introduction and a terminal prompt.
2. **Explore with Commands**:
    -   Type `help` to see a list of available commands.
    -   Use `ls` to list available files.
    -   Type `open [filename]` to view the contents of a specific file (e.g., `open about_me.txt`).
    -   Use `whoami` to get information about the current user and system.
    -   Type `clear` to clear the terminal screen.
    -   Use `reboot` to restart the terminal simulation.
3. **Side Navigation**:
    -   Click the '☰' icon on the top left to open the side navigation menu.
    -   Click any file name in the side navigation to automatically type the `open` command for that file in the terminal.
