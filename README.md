# Germabyte's Website

This is a fake terminal interface that lets you chat with an AI pretending to be… well, me.

It’s built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a custom Cloudflare Worker acting as a proxy to Claude 3.5.

No frameworks, no build tools — just browser-native stuff, hosted on GitHub Pages.

That’s it. Just a weird little idea I had.
